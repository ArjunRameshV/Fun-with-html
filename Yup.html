<h1>WELCOME</h1>
<p>This is just the intoductory website of a much <em>greater</em> project which is coming up soon. Ok you got me , I'm to lazy to figure out a good web page layout for this webite-ish
display of contents. Well along with pretty much a lot of dry apologies also comes a promise to keep this site-ish page <strong>updated 
and developed as the days move on.</strong></p>
<p>The biggest mistake we make are the ones we <em>never thought of</em>. This basic fact is due to the human charecter that we find hard to accept.</p>  

<p>Now lets try some cool features like what you are about to see :</p>
<ul><h3>Well this is an unordered list </h3>
<li>The em elements does <em>this</em></li>
<li>The strong elements does <strong> this </strong></li>
<li>The link elemnet does <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp"> this </a></li>
<li>This is an image <img src="download.jpg" alt="Supposed to be Bugs Bunny"></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Now that I think of it we need some color once in a while. Hey whats the point of looking at a Panda without actuall having the pleasure of looking at one.</p>
<p style="color:red" >You know what</p>
<hr style="color:pink"> 
<p style="color:green"> it not much fun</p> 
<hr>
<p style="color:blue"> without some color</p>
<hr>
 <p> to add to the fun. OH ya and by the way those lines I made was to make sure you understood that there is a difference in the color used. <strong>Nah!</strong>, 
I just put them there to make the page look cool.
</p>

<p>Ever heard of pre-formatted text. Well if you aven't I'm sure i caused a peak in your curiosity . </p>
<pre>Well this is an example of pre-formatted text   
where I don't have to make a new paragraph or add a line break 
to give my ideas a form. <strong>Caution!</strong>, the simple tag might give you a funny text format.
</pre>
<p>Know what , if you still feel like this page isn't opening your mind , don't feel shy to click <strong><a href="file:///C:/Users/arjun/Desktop/cp/A.html">HERE</a></strong>.</p>
<p> Well now lets see what one can really do using HTML, Nah just kidding , this is just gonna be another fun link for you to <strong><a href="file:///C:/Users/arjun/Desktop/cp/B.html">explore</a></strong> other wonders of html.</p>
