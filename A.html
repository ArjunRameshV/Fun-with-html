<h1 style="color:green">Hello Again </h1>
<p>This time the topic of discussion will be how color really causes an impact in the world around us.</p>
<p style="color:red">When you see this color, what is the first thing that comes to your mind ?. <img src="rose.jpg" alt="Who plucked the rose?" align=right> </p>
<br><br>
Is it the beautiful and magestic flower and symbol of love the rose , whose ever lasting beauty quenches the thirst of the desert dunes.
Or does it make you afraid that something might go wrong and that you would want to escape the situation.
<p>Well that is left to you to answer. Now moving on lets try to spice things up with a little more style.</p>
<ul><h3>Now let us see some different types of fonts :</h3>
<li style="font-family:courier;">This is the courier.</li>
<li style="font-family:verdana;">This is verdana.</li>
<li style="font-family:times;"> This is times.</li>
<li style="font-family:arial;">This is arial.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ol><h3>Well now lets experiment with the <em>size</em> , yah you heard me size matters :</h3>
<li style="font-size:300%;">Well this is where it all begins.</li>
<li style="font-size:200%;">Well then we reach this place.</li>
<li style="font-size:150%;>Well then here. </li>
